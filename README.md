# pickpick
pickpick is a tiny utility to select all layers to the right of your cursor.

## Why?
Faster than drag to select, and I used to have it in DTP software way back, when computers ran on diesel.

## How?
Right click context menu, or simplest ctrl+, cmd+, search for 'pickpick'.

**Known issue:**
If you hold down the right mouse button as you go through the menus, the selection will be wrong, since you moved the mouse sideways. Click and release, then go through the menus.

Or do the quick action menu: ctrl/cmd+,

## Where to test?
See the figma community file and test it out there.
